        <H3>HW#2: Package Management on different OS</H3>

        <H4>Summary:</H4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to install a few
          software packages on a few different operating systems or operating
          system flavors.  You will learn to use the standard package
          management tools of each as well how to build software manually
	  as well as how to create a package for a piece of software to
	  install on another system.
	</p>
	<p>
          At the same time, you will practice using the EC2
          command-line tools to create and administer the different OS
          instances.  Writing the documentation to perform these tasks will
          again be part of your assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a longer assignment consisting of multiple parts; it is
	  worth 75 points.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="instances"></a>OS Instances</h4>
        <p>
          The exercises below will be done <em>once for each</em> of the following
          operating systems/AMIs:
          <ul>
            <li>"Getting Started on Fedora Core 8" (AMI Id: ami-b232d0db)</li>
            <li>Ubuntu 13.04 (AMI Id: ami-1fb63576, or see <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/">this page</a>)</li>
            <li>OmniOS stable r151004 (AMI Id: ami-4e2c9727)</strike></li>
            <li>a FreeBSD instance (AMI Id: ami-9d38baf4, or see <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-on-ec2/">this page</a>)</li>
	    <li>a NetBSD instance (AMI Id: ami-5d0f8034, or see <a href="http://wiki.netbsd.org/amazon_ec2/amis/">this page</a>)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <H4>Creating the instance</H4>
        <p>
          <em>Using the EC2 command-line tools</em>, create an instance of each of the
          above listed AMIs.  (You can do this in parallel, or sequentially,
          as you prefer.)  Familiarize yourself with all available
          command-line tools, most notably, of course, the following commands:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>ec2-describe-images</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-add-group</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-describe-group</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-authorize</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-run-instances</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-describe-instances</tt></li>
            <li><tt>ec2-get-console-output</tt></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

       <H4><a name="software"></a>Install software using the native package managemer</H4>
	<p><em><small>25 points</small></em></p>
       <p>
         On each instance, use the OS's native package manager (finding out
         whichever that is and how to use it is part of the assignment) to
         install the following packages (if not already installed):
         <ul>
           <li>gcc</li>
           <li>perl</li>
           <li>python</li>
           <li>gpg (sometimes known as gnupg)</li>
           <li>screen</li>
           <li>sudo</li>
           <li>sipcalc</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
         Though not part of this assignment, you probably should familiarize
         yourself with these tools.
       </p>

       <h4>Install software "by hand"</h4>
	<p><em><small>25 points</small></em></p>
       <p>
	Choose any one of the Linux systems listed above as well as one of
	the non-Linux system.  Then, install <a
	href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> on each without
	using the package manager.  That is, download the software and follow the
	instructions provided by the software to install it.
       </p>

	<h4>Create an RPM for "Statsd"</h4>
	<p><em><small>25 points</small></em></p>
	<p>
	  On an RPM based Linux system (such as the Fedora instance noted
	  above), create an RPM for the <a
	  href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">Statsd</a> software package.
	  Verify that the resulting package can be installed on a new
	  instance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Your submission for this part of the homework will include the
	  <tt>.spec</tt> file you created.
	</p>

       <H4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
       <p>
         Your deliverable is a single flat text file (plain ascii, preferably
         created via a unix editor such as <tt>vi(1)</tt>).  The file needs
         to contain:
         <ul>
           <li>your full name</li>
           <li>your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt> email address</li>
           <li>reasonably detailed step-by-step instructions on how you
               completed each part of this assignment</li>
           <li>a <tt>.spec</tt> file for the statsd RPM</li>
           <li>any gained insights / commentary on what you have
               learned</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
         The due date for this assignment is 2013-02-25 18:00.  Please
         attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
         email address to <a
         href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] HW2">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
         with a subject of "[CS615] HW2".
