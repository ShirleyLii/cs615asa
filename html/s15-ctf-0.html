	<h4>Level 0</h4>
	<p>
	The instructions for the next level are, of course, top secret.
	Hence, they can only be made available in encrypted form.
	Likewise, we want to ensure that only authorized parties have
	access to these instructions.
	</p>
	<p>
	We accomplish this by using <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good
	Privacy</a> (PGP).  If you don't know how to use PGP yet, maybe <a
	href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gpg+tutorial">this link</a> will help.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your team needs to send an email encrypted with <a
	href="/~jschauma/public_key.gpg.asc">this key</a> to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] level 0">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS615] level 0".  In this email, you must
	note:
	<ul>
		<li>the name of your team</li>
		<li>the Stevens usernames of all members of your team</li>
		<li>the PGP key id(s) of all team members' public keys<br>
		    (if the public keys are not available on the
keyservers, please also include them)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Each team may submit this email exactly one time in any 24 hour
	window.  If not all the correct information is contained in the
	email or it is not properly encrypted, then that team must wait
	for 24 hours to try again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Upon successful completion of this task, you will
	receive (encrypted) instructions on how to proceed to the next
	level.
