        <H3>HW#2: Software packaging</H3>

        <H4>Summary:</H4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to create a
	  reliable, useful binary software package for a moderately
	  complex piece of software with a few dependencies.  The
	  resulting package will be able to be installed on a newly
	  created, RPM based EC2 instance simply by copying it to the host
	  and running the appropriate <tt>rpm(1)</tt> command.  The
	  location of the files installed by the package will follow the
	  file system hierarchy standard (ie. <tt>hier(7)</tt>), and best
	  packaging practices.
	</p>

	<h4>Details</h4>
	<p><em><small>25 points</small></em></p>
	<p>
	  On a Fedora instance (<em>ami-3b361952</em>), create an RPM for
	  the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS command-line utilities</a>,
	  or "awscli" software.
	  Verify that the resulting package can be installed on a new
	  instance.
	</p>

	<H4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>
	  As before, your deliverable is a document describing what you did
	  to produce the RPM in a manner that would allow somebody else to
	  reproduce the steps.  In addition, you will provide the
	  <em>spec</em> file from which a binary package can be created as
	  well as the <tt>rpm(1)</tt> command(s) used to generate the
	  package.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The files will be made available on your course folder under
	  <tt>https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~your-username/CS615/HW2/</tt>.
	  Please attach a copy of the files to an email sent from your
	  <tt>@stevens.edu</tt> email address to <a
	  href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615] HW2">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	  with a subject of "[CS615] HW2".
       </p>

         The due date for this assignment is 2015-03-09 16:00 Eastern.
