        <H3>HW#1: Setup your environment for EC2 and create an instance</H3>

        <H4>Summary:</H4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to set up your
          working environment (ie your account on <a
          href="https://www.stevens.edu/itwiki/w/index.php/Linux_Lab">linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</a>)
          to make it easy for you to interact with the
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Compute Cloud</a>.  As
          providing good documentation is an important part of System Administration,
          you should create your own reference document that outlines how you set up
          your environment and what steps you need to take to create a new EC2
          instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The documentation you write should be theoretically suitable for
          anybody, as a kind of HOWTO.  Please make sure to not include any
          private information.  It is perfectly acceptable for you to
          reference other publicly available documents (and this is preferable
          to you copy-and-pasting other contents into your documentation).
          Likewise, it is perfectly acceptable to publicly ask (and answer!)
          questions, for example in the <a
          href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/forum.jspa?forumID=30">AWS
          Forum</a> or our course mailing list.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to setting up your first instance, you will also
          familiarize yourself with some of the commands relating to filesystems,
          disks and storage as we will discuss in lecture #2.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment is worth 25 points.
        </p>

        <H5>Review provided documentation</H5>
        <p>
          Make sure to carefully read through the following documentation:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-getting-started-with-amazon-ec2">How To: Getting Started with Amazon EC2</a></li>
            <li><a
              href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">Getting
Started with Amazon EC2 Linux Instances</a></li>
	    <li><a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS Command Line Interface</a></li>
           </ul>
         </p>
	<p>
	<em>Note</em>: some of these links (or other documents you may
	find online on your own) may by now be outdated, use
	older tools or be flat out wrong. Do not blindly follow the instructions
	without understanding them!
	</p>

         <H5>Set up your environment</H5>
         <p>
           You need to set up your environment for interaction with the Amazon
           Cloud.  You need to create a
           document outlining what steps you took to customize or update your
           setup, such as changes to your shell's startup files, environment variables etc.
           On <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> the Amazon EC2 and related cloud
           tools are already installed.  Please use the <tt>aws</tt>
           command found in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> -- see <tt>aws help</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>
	   Please note that we will only focus on using the command-line
	   tools for EC2.  That is, your HOWTO should describe the setup
	   to use these tools and <em>not</em> how to use the browser
	   based interface.  Your documentation will <em>not</em> include
	   sentences like "...then click on..." or "...select from the
           menu..." or anything like that.
         </p>

         <H5>Create an EC2 instance</H5>
         <p>
           Create an EC2 instance of "OmniOS stable r151004" and start it.
           Once it is running, log in on the virtual host
           and run the required commands to:
           <ul>
             <li>display basic system information</li>
             <li>display the partition table</li>
             <li>display the currently mounted filesystems</li>
             <li>display available disk space</li>
           </ul>
           After you are done, remember to shut down your instance.
         </p>
         <p>
	   Repeat the same process for a Linux instance (no matter what
           version).
         </p>

         <H5>Deliverables and Due Date</H5>
         <p>
          You will create a publicly accessible website under
          <tt>https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~<em>your-username</em>/CS615/HW1/</tt>.  In here,
          you will provide your documentation in HTML or plain text format, including
          the following information:
          <ul>
            <li>reasonably detailed step-by-step instructions on how you set
                up or customized your working environment</li>
            <li>reasonably detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create
                and start an instance of the given OS type and log in</li>
            <li>the output of the following commands run on your running
                instances (ie once for OpenSolaris, once for Linux):
                <ul>
                  <li><tt>uname -a</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>whoami</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>date</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>w</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>ifconfig -a</tt></li>
                  <li><tt>netstat -na</tt></li>
                  <li>the commands you determine to be used to display the
                      partition table, currently mounted filesystems, disk
                      space</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
           </ul>
           </p>
           <p>
