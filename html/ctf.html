        <H3>Capture The Flag!</H3>

	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
	In this group assignment, your task is to "capture the flag" by
	solving a few exercises and problems of increasing
	difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
	The final "flag" is to take control of a web server.
        </p>
        <p>
	Each level has one intended solution.  Solving all levels in order
	should allow you to capture the flag.  However, it is possible
	that you can solve a level in a way not anticipated by the
	instructor, or that you can capture the flag without solving all
	or some of the levels.  That's perfectly fine.
        </p>
	<h4>Final Flag</h4>
	<p>
	The final flag is to take control of this site: <a
	href="http://cs615asa.netmeister.org">http://cs615asa.netmeister.org</a>
	by having the site display your team's name and members.  Once you
	have accomplished this, you need to defend it against take-over by
	another team.
	</p>
	<h4>Points</h4>
	<p>
	Capturing (and defending) the flag will gain each of your team's
	member 75 points.
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual levels may gain you partial credit along the way.  If
	you solve all individual levels and capture the flag, you will
	gain a total of 75 points; if you find another way to capture the
	flag, you will gain 75 points.  That is, you cannot gain
	<em>more</em> than 75 points, but if you attempt to capture the
	flag without solving any of the levels and then fail, you will not
	get any points.
	</p>
	<h4>Groups</h4>
	<p>
	All work is to be done in groups as noted <a
	href="ctf-groups">here</a>.  All members of
	the group are expected to participate equally
	in solving all levels, and are expected to be
	able to fully explain the solution for any
	level.
	</p>
	<h4>Proving levels</h4>
	<p>
	In order to claim the points for a given level (including the
	final flag), you must write a document describing how you solved
	the problem.  The document <em>must</em> be:
        <ul>
          <li>plain ascii text</li>
          <li>well-formatted with paragraphs and line-breaks &lt; 80 chars</li>
          <li>named README</li>
          <li>accompanied by detached PGP signatures
of all team members</li>
        </ul>
	Please send your submissions via email to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>.  Note:
	any failure to meet the above requirements
	will lead to the submission being rejected
	as incorrect without any further comments.
	</p>
	<p>
	48 hours after a level has been solved by any one team, it will be
	opened up and the points will no longer be available.
	</p>
