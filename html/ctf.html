        <H3>Capture The Flag!</H3>

	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
	In this group assignment, your task is to "capture the flag" by
	solving a few exercises and problems of increasing
	difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
	The final "flag" is to take control of, and then defend against
	the other teams, the content of a web server.  Note that in this
	game you are simultaneously attackers and defenders: you are
	working against time, trying to solve the problems, while at the
	same time trying to work against the other teams.
        </p>
        <p>
	Each level has one intended solution.  Solving all levels in order
	should allow you to capture the flag.  However, it is possible
	that you can solve a level in a way not anticipated by the
	instructor, or that you can capture the flag without solving all
	or some of the levels.  That's perfectly fine.
        </p>
	<h4>Final Flag</h4>
	<p>
	The final flag is to take control of this site: <a
	href="http://cs615-ctf.netmeister.org">http://cs615-ctf.netmeister.org</a>
	by having the site display your team's name and members.  Once you
	have accomplished this, you need to defend it against take-over by
	another team.
	</p>
	<h4>Points</h4>
	<p>
	Capturing (and defending) the flag will gain each of your team's
	member 75 points.
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual levels may gain you partial credit along the way.  If
	you solve all individual levels and capture the flag, you will
	gain a total of 75 points; if you find another way to capture the
	flag, you will gain 75 points.  That is, you cannot gain
	<em>more</em> than 75 points, but if you attempt to capture the
	flag without solving any of the levels and then fail, you will not
	get any points.
	</p>
	<h4>Proving levels</h4>
	<p>
	In order to claim the points for a given level (including the
	final flag), you must write a document describing how you solved
	the problem.  This document must be made available online under
	one of your team member's course website (ie
	<tt>https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~yourname/615/</tt>) and the URL
	sent via email to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	After your instructor has acknowledged having retrieved the document,
	you may remove it again (for example to prevent other teams from
	finding out how you solved the problem).
	</p>
	<p>
	24 hours after a level has been solved by any one team, it will be
	opened up and the points will no longer be available.
