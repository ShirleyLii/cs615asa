.Sh NAME
.Nm flsfs
.Nd the foghorn leghorn secure file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device flsfs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Foghorn Leghorn Secure File System
provides a convenient way of storing and sharing
secrets with multiple, independent recipients.
.Pp
.Nm
usually is exposed to the end-users by way of a
pseudo-device, a raw block device, or even as a
regular file.
The flexibility of
.Nm
allows users to utilize the same format and
abstraction to access the shared secrets in a secure
manner, while at the same time providing privacy
guarantees preventing disclosure to unauthorized
parties.
.Pp
The format of
.Nm
is intentionally simple:
The first 512 bytes comprise the Table of Contents;
data is stored in the remaining blocks as indexed in
the table of contents by recipient.
.Pp
Specifically, the TOC consists of 16 entries, each
in turn being comprised of two 16 byte fields.
The first 16 bytes contain the null-terminated string
name of the recipient followed by a 16 byte integer
identifying the offset within the
.Nm
where the data for this recipient is located.
.Pp
The data at the indices itself is equally simply
structured:
At a given index, you will find 4 bytes providing the
size of the data followed by the data itself.
.Sh LIMITATIONS
This is the very first alpha release of
.Nm ,
necessarily including certain limitation.
Notably,
.Nm
is currently limited to storing at most 16 files as
per the fixed length of the TOC.
Future releases should change the format to first
provide the size of the TOC followed by the TOC.
.Pp
The files stored in
.Nm
are currently limited to 64K through the use of a 4
byte size indicator.
Future releases should allow larger files to be
stored.
.Pp
Lastly,
.Nm
is not actually very secure.
It relies on the data it stores to have been encrypted
prior to writing it to the blocks.
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
is accessed primarily via the convenient
.Xr dd 1
utility using the
.Ar /dev/flsfs
pathname.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dd 1 ,
.Xr hexdump 1
